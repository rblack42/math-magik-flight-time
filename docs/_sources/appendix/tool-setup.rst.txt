Tool Setup
##########

This section is for developers who might be interested in contributing to this
project, but who may be new to some of the tools I use. i usually develop on a
Macbook Pro, but I also teach students how to program on other platforms. For
that reason, I am including instructions covering installing the required tools
on all three platforms: Windows, Mac and Linux.
