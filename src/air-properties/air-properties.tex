\section{Air Properties}

We will need a few basic properties of air for our calculations:

The density of air, which we looked ta briefly in the last section, is assumed
to be constant in our flying sites (well, unless you fly in very tall
buildings!)


\begin{equation}
    \rho = 33.6 \frac{g}{{ft}^3}
\end{equation}

The kinematic viscosity, a measure of the "air's resistance to motion is given
next:

\begin{equation}
    \nu` = 15.88 x :math:`10^{-5}\frac{{ft}^2}{sec}`
\end{equation}
