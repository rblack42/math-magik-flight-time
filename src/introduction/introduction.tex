\section{Introduction}

In the 1976 edition of the {\it National Free Flight Society Symposium}, Doug
McLean authored an article titled {\it A Method for Predicting Indoor Model
Duration} \cite{mclean}.  Doug's method involves data from actual model
flights and simplified formulas for things like the aerodynamics and efficiency
of the model, propeller,  and the rubber powering the airplane.  In this
article, we will revisit this approach and create some Python code to help
predict the flight times for models we design using \osc\ \cite{openscad}.
