This sites hosts a revisit of Doug McLean's 1976 NFFS Symposium article "A
Method For Predicting Indoor Model Duration". In the current paper, Python code
is presented that will provide an estimate of model flight times. The code uses
the *SymPy* package to validate the math presented, and *Pint* to make sure
engineering units of measure are consistent.

This code will be included in the `Math Magik` project base at a later time.


Comments and suggestions are welcome. Please contact the author if you find any
