This site hosts a revisit of Doug McLean's 1976 NFFS Symposium article "A
Method For Predicting Indoor Model Duration". In the current paper, Python code
is presented that will provide an estimate of model flight times. The code uses
the *SymPy* package to validate the math presented, and *Pint* to make sure
engineering units of measure are consistent.

This code is part of the `Math-magic_ project, which, hopefully, will provide
more tools to assist in the designing, building, and flying of indoor model
airplanes. .

Comments and suggestions are welcome. Please contact the author if you find any
of this useful.
